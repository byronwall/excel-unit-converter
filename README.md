# Excel Unit Converter

This is a C# built Excel add-in (XLL) which provides unit conversions based on a database of unit types. It parses units from a string and converts them to a common SI form. From there, it can convert to any desired output form that is dimensionally consistent with the input.

This add-in was created at a time when I was doing a significant amount of engineering work in various units.
